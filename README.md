# SeniorProject
**Welcome to my senior project repository**

- The folders and files in this repository contain the assets and scripts necessary to play the kart game I made
- Some asset files were too large even for Git LFS.
- Follow this link to a public google drive folder with the missing texture assets.
- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18S2qOEsyTQZDJD9sh6_Hfg7hgwkmDBFd?usp=sharing
- Using these files inside of unity should allow someone to play the game I made
